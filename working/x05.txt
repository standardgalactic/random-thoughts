layer of hypothesis and one level of

perception but it's a multi-stage thing

where you have a hierarchy of more and

more concrete um features uh towards the

perception and more more abstract

towards the classification right and uh

by propagating activation back and force

this thing eventually settles into a

state where you are able to track your

sensor data that's the rough intuition

right and this is very compatible with

what you just described yeah so you have

bottom up mechanism like in a vision

model that is looking for more and more

complex features and eventually these

features correspond to objects and that

uh you have a um downward propagation

where you are basically organizing the

features into the shapes of the objects

and uh the objects are claiming the
