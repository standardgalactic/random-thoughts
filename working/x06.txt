features that belong to them yeah right

and uh what you describe is when you

remove inhibition then you there will be

a greater chance for a feature to fit

into a larger variety of objects and

conflicting features May no longer

inhibit each other so the superpositions

remain present and get integrated into

the next level object right and to some
ChatGPT dijo:
Joscha Bach's description of
hypothesis-based perception
(or "hyper") aligns well with
predictive coding
and
Bayesian inference
models of perception. His explanation suggests a
dynamic interplay between bottom-up sensory input and top-down predictive mechanisms
, which makes sense given what we know about perception and cognition.
Breaking Down His Explanation
Bottom-Up Sensory Input and Hypothesis Generation
When we receive sensory input, the brain
activates multiple possible hypotheses
simultaneously about what we are perceiving.
This is similar to how the
brain works probabilistically
, maintaining a "superposition" of potential interpretations rather than immediately selecting a single one.
Top-Down Mutual Inhibition & Active Perception
As these hypotheses compete, the brain engages in
mutual inhibition
, meaning conflicting interpretations suppress each other.
