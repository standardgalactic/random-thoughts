Simultaneously, perception becomes
active
���we don���t just passively receive input but
search for confirming or disconfirming features
to refine our hypothesis.
Why This Works for Occluded or Unclear Objects
This explains why we can recognize objects that are
partially hidden, in fog, or blurry
���we fill in gaps using our
prior knowledge
and active hypothesis testing.
Instead of waiting for perfect clarity, the brain
makes an educated guess
and adjusts as new data arrives.
Hierarchical and Iterative Processing
Perception isn���t just one layer of processing but
a multi-stage process
:
Low-level sensory data
(edges, textures, colors)
Mid-level feature extraction
(shapes, patterns)
High-level object recognition
(categorizing it as a "dog" or "car")
The brain
propagates information back and forth
between these levels, allowing refinement until a stable perception emerges.
Relaxing Inhibition for More Flexible Perception
If inhibition is reduced, features might
fit into multiple interpretations
, allowing
broader, more flexible perception
.
This could help explain
creative perception, hallucinations, or even synesthesia
, where multiple interpretations coexist rather than one dominating.
How Plausible Is This?
Neuroscientific evidence supports it.
Predictive coding models show that the brain constantly makes predictions and updates them based on errors.
It explains real-world perception.
