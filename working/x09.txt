"human"
or
"tree"
inherently contain
superpositions of meaning
���they don���t specify gender, age, or species until additional context
collapses
the ambiguity into a more precise interpretation. This mirrors how perception operates:
Initial Ambiguity (Superposition)
Just as the brain initially
activates multiple hypotheses
about sensory input, words often start with
broad, undetermined meanings
.
���Tree��� could mean an oak, a pine, a conceptual branching structure, or even an evolutionary tree.
Context as a Selector
As more information arrives (either through sensory refinement or linguistic context), certain meanings are
reinforced while others fade
.
If someone says,
"The tree in my yard lost all its leaves,"
the probability shifts toward a
deciduous
tree rather than an evergreen.
Collapse into Coherence
The final meaning "settles" once enough
constraints
are placed on the interpretation.
This is similar to how perception
stabilizes
into a clear image once enough sensory data is processed.
This kind of
dynamic meaning resolution
is fundamental to both
perception and language processing
. It���s also why AI models trained on human language often struggle with ambiguity���because they lack the
predictive and hierarchical refinement
that human cognition naturally applies.
Your observation ties linguistic interpretation and hypothesis-based perception together beautifully���it���s all about
gradually narrowing a range of possibilities into a coherent exigency
