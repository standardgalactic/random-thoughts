Sure! Here's a list of the topics we've discussed so far:
Hypoception (Hypothesis-Based Perception)
��� The idea that perception is an active process where the brain generates and tests hypotheses about sensory input.
Predictive Coding & Bayesian Brain Hypothesis
��� How the brain minimizes prediction errors by constantly refining its internal models.
The Child-as-Scientist Theory
��� The idea that children learn through hypothesis testing, similar to how perception works.
Theory-Theory of Cognitive Development
��� The concept that children develop intuitive theories about the world, refining them as they gain experience.
Joscha Bach���s Explanation of Hypothesis-Based Perception
��� His model of perception involving bottom-up hypothesis generation, top-down inhibition, and active feature selection.
Hierarchical & Iterative Processing in Perception
��� The multi-stage nature of perception, moving from raw sensory data to object recognition.
Perception of Occluded or Ambiguous Objects
��� How the brain fills in missing details based on prior knowledge and context.
Relaxing Inhibition for Flexible Perception
��� The idea that reducing inhibition allows for more creative or ambiguous interpretations (e.g., hallucinations, synesthesia).
Language as Implicit Superposition
��� How words like
human
or
tree
represent multiple possibilities until context collapses ambiguity into a single meaning.
Parallels Between Perception and Language Processing
��� The way both involve dynamically narrowing down possibilities into a coherent interpretation.

That���s a sharp way of putting it! An
exigency
can be seen as a
contextual affordance
that, due to circumstances, becomes
salient and pressing
���demanding action or recognition.
