Contextual Affordance
��� Meaning it���s an opportunity or constraint that
exists within a given context
but isn't always activated.
Becoming Salient
��� It emerges into focus when the context makes it relevant.
Becoming Pressing
��� It requires engagement, interpretation, or action because the situation demands it.
For example:
A
door handle
is always an
affordance
for opening a door, but it only becomes an
exigency
when you urgently need to escape a room.
The meaning of an
ambiguous word
remains open-ended until context forces a
collapse into a specific interpretation
(like "tree" referring to a pine or oak).
A
hypothetical perception
(a superposition of sensory possibilities) becomes
an exigent reality
when it is tested and resolved by further information.
This ties into
hypothesis-based perception
beautifully���our cognitive system is constantly navigating between
potential affordances
and
pressing exigencies
based on evolving context.
