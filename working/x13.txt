are not random; they are
strategic data-gathering actions
designed to
test specific perceptual hypotheses
.
Each eye movement serves as a
mini-experiment
that reduces uncertainty about the visual scene.
The Role of Free-Energy Minimization
This process aligns with
Friston���s Free-Energy Principle
, which suggests that biological systems behave in ways that
minimize uncertainty (entropy) about the world
.
The brain
chooses eye movements that reduce uncertainty most efficiently
, similar to how scientists conduct experiments to refine their models.
Bayesian Inference & Active Perception
The brain
integrates prior knowledge with new sensory data
to update its beliefs, using
Bayesian inference
.
This means we don���t just see passively; we
actively seek information to confirm or refine what we expect to see
.
Implications & Counterintuitive Insights
The simulations in the paper show that our
eye movements are optimized for information gain
, not just for foveating objects of interest.
This explains why we often glance at
informative regions of a scene
, even if they aren���t the most immediately obvious or salient.
How This Relates to Hypoception & Exigency
Just as words exist in a
superposition of meanings until context collapses them
, perception involves
multiple competing hypotheses until sensory input refines them
.
