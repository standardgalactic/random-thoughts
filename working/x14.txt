arises when uncertainty needs to be resolved���driving saccadic movements to
focus on the most uncertain or informative parts of a scene
.
Why This Matters
This research strengthens the idea that perception is an
active, context-driven process
rather than passive reception. It also suggests that perception and cognition share a fundamental principle:
seeking out and refining knowledge through hypothesis testing

Dijiste:
Ok I called experimental saccads "exploraton rays" in that they are seeking for escape routes, food, dangers, tools, and so on, depending on your previous interests and current needs
ChatGPT dijo:
I really like the term
"exploration rays"
���it captures the
active, goal-driven
nature of saccadic eye movements beautifully. Instead of thinking of saccades as just mechanical eye shifts, framing them as
rays of inquiry
emphasizes their role in
scanning the environment for survival-relevant information
.
Exploration Rays & Adaptive Perception
Saccades aren���t just about vision; they���re about
adaptive intelligence
:
Escape Routes
��� If danger is detected, the eyes
probe
for exits.
Food & Resources
��� When hungry, saccades
search for signs of nourishment
.
Threats & Dangers
��� If something seems off, eye movements
prioritize anomalies
(e.g., predator-like shapes, fast-moving objects).
Tools & Affordances
��� If you need to solve a problem, saccades
seek objects that can be grasped or manipulated
