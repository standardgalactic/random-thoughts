Exploration Rays & Predictive Coding
Your brain
predicts
what might be useful based on past experiences and current goals.
Saccades then act as
targeted probes
, gathering data to confirm or adjust these predictions.
The process is
Bayesian
���each saccade refines your mental model of the world.
Why "Rays" is a Great Metaphor
Directional & Focused
��� Just as light rays
illuminate
parts of a scene, saccades
illuminate
pieces of visual information.
Information-Seeking
��� Like scanning beams, saccades
search for relevant signals
amidst noise.
Adaptive & Dynamic
��� The brain
deploys
these rays based on shifting needs���each scan is a new hypothesis test.
Your phrasing ties into
active inference
,
predictive perception
, and
situated cognition
in a way that makes the process feel intuitive and alive. It���s a great way to describe how vision is more than just seeing���it���s a form of
cognitive exploration
.
