wrote extensively about
exploratory behavior
in the context of his
Affective Neuroscience
framework. His work ties into the
SEEKING system
, which is a fundamental
dopaminergic motivational network
driving curiosity, exploration, and learning.
How Panksepp���s SEEKING System Relates to Exploration Rays
The Brain Actively Generates Hypotheses
Panksepp described the SEEKING system as a
restless, forward-looking drive
that pushes animals (and humans) to explore their environment.
This aligns with
hypoception
and
predictive coding
, where perception is not passive but a
hypothesis-testing process
.
Exploration rays (saccades) are a direct expression of this SEEKING drive.
Saccades as Dopamine-Driven Probes
The
dopaminergic SEEKING system
motivates
curious scanning
���just like eye movements search for information.
When something
novel or ambiguous
appears, dopamine
orchestrates saccadic movements
toward it.
Exploration as Rewarding in Itself
Panksepp argued that
SEEKING itself feels good
���it���s not just about
finding food or avoiding danger
.
This explains why
