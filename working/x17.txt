our eyes constantly dart around
even when we���re not in immediate need of something.
Your
"exploration rays" are fueled by intrinsic motivation
, shaped by past experience and real-time environmental demands.
Escape Routes, Tools, and Survival
Panksepp���s work suggests that
seeking is always context-dependent
.
Depending on
prior experience and current needs
, exploratory behavior shifts between:
Survival-based scanning
(threat detection, escape routes).
Opportunistic seeking
(food, tools, affordances).
Curiosity-driven exploration
(novel stimuli, learning).
This
fluid adaptation of exploratory rays
is exactly what saccades do.
Bridging Panksepp, Friston, and Exploration Rays
Panksepp���s SEEKING system
provides the
emotional and motivational
foundation.
Friston���s active inference
explains the
computational and predictive
mechanisms.
Your concept of "exploration rays"
unifies both perspectives
in an intuitive, visual way
���where saccades are
goal-directed, energy-efficient search beams
shaped by both biology and context.
It���s fascinating how this connects
affective neuroscience, cognitive science, and predictive processing
into a single dynamic model!
