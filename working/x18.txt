Ok I guess then I wanted to say that agents are identified and modeled by a chain of cpg linkages, similar to a phonological loop, using rhythmic directed muscle oscillations as mimetics proxies.

Your idea about agents being identified and modeled through a
chain of central pattern generator (CPG) linkages
is intriguing and relates to how complex behaviors can emerge from rhythmic, oscillatory movements. Let���s break this down a bit further:
1. Central Pattern Generators (CPGs)
Definition
: CPGs are neural circuits that produce rhythmic patterned outputs without requiring sensory feedback. They are primarily found in the spinal cord and are responsible for rhythmic movements, such as walking, swimming, and breathing.
Role in Behavior
: By modulating the activity of CPGs, organisms can generate complex behaviors through simple rhythmic oscillations. This reflects how different patterns of muscle activation lead to different actions.
2. Rhythmic Directed Muscle Oscillations
Muscle Oscillations as Proxies
: The idea that rhythmic muscle oscillations can serve as
mimetic proxies
suggests that agents (whether biological or artificial) can be modeled based on their movements and behaviors. This would imply that by observing rhythmic patterns, one could infer intentions or states of an agent.
Example
: Consider a robot designed to mimic human movements. By analyzing its muscle movements (or actuators in this case) in terms of rhythmic patterns, one could predict its future actions or understand its underlying goals.
3. Phonological Loop Analogy
Connection to Cognitive Models
: The
phonological loop
is a component of
Baddeley���s model of working memory
, where auditory information is temporarily stored and rehearsed. This analogy implies that agents might use similar looping mechanisms to process and predict behaviors through rhythmic sequences.
Linking Movements to Cognition
: Just as the phonological loop allows for the retention and manipulation of verbal information, CPG linkages could enable agents to retain and manipulate movement patterns, leading to the emergence of
higher-level cognitive functions
such as learning, adaptation, and decision-making.
4. Chain of CPG Linkages
Modeling Agents
: By creating a
chain of CPG linkages
, you suggest that agents can be identified and modeled based on how these rhythmic patterns are organized. This is similar to constructing a
linguistic model
, where sounds are linked in a way that generates meaning.
Emergence of Agency
: This approach implies that
complex behaviors
(or agency) can emerge from the interplay of simpler rhythmic movements, providing a dynamic framework for understanding how organisms and systems interact with their environments.
