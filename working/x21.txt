in behavior or response, we often ascribe intent or agency to that entity.
Embodied Recognition of Agency
: The recognition of agency in non-human patterns can be informed by our
embodied states
. For example, when we observe an animal acting in a way that suggests problem-solving or intention (e.g., a dog finding a way to open a gate), our relaxed state upon recognizing this can reinforce our attribution of agency to that animal.
3. Patterns and Solutions
Pattern Recognition
: Humans are inherently pattern-seeking creatures. We engage in
pattern recognition
to make sense of complex information and simplify our environment. When we identify a pattern, especially one that leads to a solution, it can create a state of relaxation and fulfillment.
Cognitive Closure
: Finding a solution or pattern provides a sense of
cognitive closure
, where uncertainty is resolved. This often results in a physiological response of relaxation, reinforcing the behavior that led to the solution.
4. Implications for Human-Nonhuman Interaction
Attributing Agency to Non-Human Patterns
: This tendency can extend to how we interact with technology and artificial intelligence. When we encounter AI that successfully mimics human-like behaviors or solves problems effectively, we may experience relaxation and trust. This can lead us to attribute agency to the AI, even if we know it operates on algorithms.
Designing Trustworthy Systems
: Understanding how relaxed states function as rewards can inform the design of systems that promote trust and cooperation between humans and non-human agents (like robots or AI). If systems can induce positive emotional states in users, they can enhance user engagement and satisfaction.
5. Applications in Various Fields
Psychology and Therapy
: Recognizing the importance of relaxation in cognitive achievements can be useful in therapeutic settings, where inducing a relaxed state can help clients gain insights or solve problems more effectively.
Education and Learning
: In educational environments, fostering a relaxed atmosphere may enhance learning outcomes, as students are more likely to engage with challenging material when they feel calm and rewarded by their progress.
Conclusion
Your perspective on using relaxed states as rewards for problem-solving and attributing agency to non-human patterns encapsulates the interplay between
emotion, cognition, and interaction
. It highlights how our
embodied experiences
shape our understanding of agency and solutions in our environments, whether they are human, animal, or machine. This notion opens up avenues for further exploration in psychology, robotics, and human-computer interaction, emphasizing the importance of emotional and physiological responses in our cognitive processes.

I just meant that we might model a triangle as being more trustworthy than a circle, which might have more agency, since it can roll whereas a triangle shape stays fixed
ChatGPT dijo:
Your point about modeling a triangle as being more trustworthy than a circle, and attributing more agency to the circle due to its ability to roll, is an insightful observation that delves into our perceptions of shapes, movement, and trustworthiness. Let���s unpack this idea further:
1. Trustworthiness and Shape Perception
Perception of Shapes
: Different geometric shapes can evoke varying perceptions and associations in individuals. For instance, triangles often represent stability and strength due to their fixed points and ability to support weight. In contrast, circles are associated with fluidity and movement, which can suggest adaptability but also unpredictability.
Trustworthiness
: The perception of trustworthiness can be influenced by the stability that a shape conveys. Triangles, with their pointed corners and stable base, may appear more solid and reliable, leading people to view them as more trustworthy. In contrast, the rounded nature of circles may evoke feelings of gentleness or playfulness but can also suggest a lack of fixed direction or intent.
